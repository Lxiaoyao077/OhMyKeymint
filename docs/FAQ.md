# Frequently Asked Questions

This page is for people who use OhMyKeymint (OMK) without needing to
understand Android internals. It describes the current behavior. If a setting
is not explained here, leave it at its default value. See the
[Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION.md) for complete annotated examples and a
separate explanation of every field.

## What OMK does

### What is OhMyKeymint?

Android has a secure key service that apps use to create keys and check device
information. OMK provides an alternative version of that service for the apps
you select.

OMK only covers this part of Android. It is not a general root-hiding tool, a
Play Integrity module, or a repair tool for damaged security hardware.

### Will OMK make every banking app, payment app, or detector work?

No. Apps may check root, installed modules, system properties, certificates,
hooks, their own files, and many other signals that OMK does not control. A
good result in one test app, including a Play Integrity `STRONG` result, does
not guarantee that another app will accept the device.

If an app shows exactly the same warning with and without OMK, that warning
probably comes from something OMK does not control. If the message or behavior
changes between the two tests, the cause is still unknown; collect fresh logs
from both attempts instead of guessing.

### Which devices are supported?

The supported production range is:

- Android 12 through Android 17;
- `arm64-v8a` devices; and
- Linux kernels 4.14 through 6.18, plus newer LTS kernels.

Android 11 and older are not supported. An installer may run on another
version or architecture, but that does not make it an officially supported
setup.

### Does OMK add StrongBox to a phone that does not have it?

No. StrongBox is hardware. OMK cannot create it on a device that does not have
it. Apps that require real StrongBox may still reject such a device.

### Can I use OMK with other root or KeyStore modules?

Use only one root implementation. KernelSU and Magisk are the supported ways
to install OMK; recovery installation is not supported.

Do not run OMK together with another module that replaces Android's KeyStore
or KeyMint service. When two modules change the same service, results are
unpredictable and cannot be diagnosed reliably.

## Installing, updating, and removing

### How should I install OMK?

Download an official ZIP, keep it as a ZIP, and install it from the KernelSU
or Magisk app while Android is running. Reboot before testing it.

Do not extract, edit, or repack the ZIP. If the installer says that a file is
missing or verification failed, download the package again from the official
source.

### How should I update OMK?

Install the current release over the existing installation in the root manager,
then reboot. The update keeps the active settings, keybox, and stored OMK keys.

### Is downgrading safe?

No.

### What should I back up?

Before testing a development build, or making a large
configuration change, privately back up:

- `/data/misc/keystore/omk/config.toml`
- `/data/misc/keystore/omk/injector.toml`
- `/data/misc/keystore/omk/keybox.xml`
- `/data/misc/keystore/omk/data/`

Treat the backup like a password. It can contain private keys and device
identifiers. A backup is a safety measure, not a portable copy that is
guaranteed to work on another device.

### What happens if I disable or uninstall OMK?

Disable it in the root manager when you need to keep OMK's persistent data.
Keys created through OMK are not converted into normal System keys, so some
selected apps may ask you to sign in or register again after OMK is disabled.

When **Oh My Keymint is uninstalled from KernelSU**, its uninstaller removes
exactly `/data/adb/omk` and `/data/misc/keystore/omk` before the module directory
is deleted. This permanently removes OMK configuration, logs, keybox data, and
OMK-created keys; affected apps may need to be registered or signed in again.
Reboot after the uninstall. Disabling the module does not run this cleanup.

## Choosing apps and changing settings

### How do I open the WebUI?

In KernelSU, open Oh My Keymint from the module list and select its WebUI.

In Magisk, open an installed KSUWebUIStandalone or WebUI X host and select Oh
My Keymint. Install one of those WebUI hosts separately if neither is present.

### Does the WebUI use the network, and what can it change?

Its application code, icons, and language files are bundled with OMK. Normal
local operations do not use the network. **Sync security patch** invokes the
module's native HTTPS client to request Google's
official `source.android.com` Android Security Bulletin overview, with the
official Chinese mirror as a fallback. It extracts the newest published patch
month. If the saved default `ro.build.version.security_patch` uses day `01`,
the synchronized value uses day `01` in that month; a saved day `05` or any
other day keeps Google's published date. When the saved system and vendor
dates differ, the system date determines this behavior. The helper updates the
four `[trust]` patch-level fields and also sets
`ro.build.version.security_patch` and `ro.vendor.build.security_patch` to that
date with `resetprop`. Before the first sync, it saves both current property
values in
`/data/misc/keystore/omk/data/security_patch_defaults.toml`; repeated syncs keep
the existing defaults snapshot. While that snapshot remains valid and all four
patch fields still hold one exact date, the module's early boot hook reapplies
the paired properties before Android framework values are cached; keymint also
reapplies them at startup. A manual exact-date configuration without the
snapshot does not trigger that additional vendor-property write. A snapshot
error skips this optional reapply without preventing keymint from starting. The native
client validates TLS with embedded WebPKI roots, so the device does not need to
provide `curl` or `wget`. HTTPS redirects are accepted only when the final URL
remains the official bulletin page.

**Restore default security patch** is local and makes no network request. It
first restores both properties from that snapshot, then sets `security_patch`,
`os_patchlevel`, `vendor_patchlevel`, and `boot_patchlevel` to `"auto"` while
preserving all other configuration values. The snapshot is deleted only after
the properties and configuration are restored successfully. These properties
are global runtime state for the current boot, so other processes can observe
their synchronized or restored values. After a successful synchronization or
restore, the WebUI shows a completion message and asks you to reboot the device;
it does not reboot automatically.

A network, HTTP, or parsing failure occurs before anything is changed. Snapshot
validation or creation failures also leave the properties and configuration
unchanged. The native helper verifies paired property writes and rolls them back
when an update cannot complete. If the configuration write fails, it attempts
to restore the preceding property values. A failed restore keeps the snapshot
available for another attempt and reports the error in the WebUI.

The WebUI also reads and replaces `scoop` and can install a local XML file
selected through Android's system document picker as the active keybox. The
picker can use another installed storage app such as MT Manager and requests
all MIME types because providers may label XML as `text/plain` or
`application/octet-stream`; the WebUI still requires an `.xml` filename. If the
system picker cannot be opened, the WebUI falls back to its shared-storage
browser. It does not change `[crypto]`, device identity, or unrelated
configuration settings.

The Home page checks every certificate serial number in the active Keybox
against Google's attestation status list. A valid online response is cached at
`/data/misc/keystore/omk/data/google_attestation_status.json`; when Google is
unreachable, the validated local cache is used, with the module's validated
snapshot as the first-install fallback. It shows **Not revoked** when no serial
is present in the selected list and **Revoked** when any serial is marked
`SUSPENDED` or `REVOKED`. If all sources fail validation, the result remains a
check failure and is not reported as **Not revoked**. The local list can be
stale, and absence from it does not mean that the Keybox passes Play Integrity.
The **Security Level** row is read from the active Keybox certificate and shows
`TEE`, `StrongBox`, or an unknown value when the certificate does not identify
either level.
Continue to manage those settings through the documented active files.

The **ADB Disabler** controls
developer options, USB debugging, and OEM unlock independently. Its four
settings are persisted under OMK's data directory and replayed by the module at
boot; disabling its master switch stops future replay but does not restore
properties already changed during the current boot.

### What happens when the WebUI saves the app list?

The WebUI passes the selected package names to the native `inject` helper. The
helper validates the existing complete `injector.toml` and every exact package
name, removes duplicates, and atomically replaces the file while preserving
its ownership and permissions. The injector then hot-reloads the valid file
for new requests.

If loading, parsing, validation, or writing fails, the WebUI reports the error
and the existing file is not replaced. Saving is unavailable when the current
list could not be loaded. The package selector refreshes installed apps when it
opens and when the WebUI returns to the foreground, while preserving unsaved
selections.

### Where are the active settings?

The active files are:

- `/data/misc/keystore/omk/config.toml`
- `/data/misc/keystore/omk/injector.toml`

Edit the active files, not the copies inside the module ZIP. Make a backup
first and use a root-capable editor that preserves the files correctly.
The [Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION.md) explains every field and when each
kind of change takes effect. The embedded WebUI is an optional editor for
`scoop`, an installer for a locally selected keybox, and controls for syncing
or restoring the four security-patch fields and the two corresponding runtime
properties; it does not expose the other settings.

### What is `scoop`?

`scoop` is the list of app package names that may use OMK. A package name looks
like `com.example.app`; it is not the name shown under the app icon. It must be
entered exactly.

You can often find the package name at the end of the app's Play Store URL,
after `id=`. Add only apps that you actually want OMK to handle.

Keep the `scoop = [` and closing `]` lines in `injector.toml`, and put one
package name on each line between them. Bare entries do not need quotes or
commas (the quoted, comma-separated TOML form is still accepted).

The embedded WebUI lists installed packages and updates this same `scoop`
value. It accepts exact package names only and does not support `!`, `?`,
wildcards, labels, or partial names.

### Why is an app affected even though I did not add it?

The default list is not empty. It includes Google Services Framework, Google
Play services, Play Store, and two common test apps. Also, a few related apps
share one Android identity, so selecting one can affect another app in the
same group.

The active `injector.toml` is authoritative and is not replaced during an
update.

### Can I enable OMK for every app?

OMK is designed for selected apps, and there is no official one-click
"all apps" mode. Keep the filter enabled and add only the apps that need OMK.
Intercepting Android, system services, or unknown callers can break unlocking,
app storage, or the user interface.

Problems caused by deliberately allowing Android or system callers are outside
the project's support scope. Restore the default filter before asking for
help.

### Which settings should ordinary users leave alone?

Keep these defaults unless a maintainer gives you a specific reason to change
them:

- keep the filter enabled;
- keep Android packages blocked and unknown callers rejected;
- leave every switch under `[intercept]` enabled;
- keep `os_version`, all four patch-level fields, `vb_key`, and `vb_hash` on
  their documented automatic settings; and
- never change generated values under `[crypto]`.

The biometric verification bypass is an insecure compatibility option, not a
general fix for fingerprint errors or app root detection. Changing `[crypto]`
values can make existing OMK keys unusable.

### How do I apply a setting change?

Both components notice valid edits automatically, but not every keymint value
can be replaced safely while it is running. Injector settings apply to new
requests; the four patch-level fields can apply together when no other
`[trust]` field changes, and the biometric compatibility switch can also apply
without a keymint restart. Changes to `[crypto]`, other `[trust]` fields, device
identity fields, or the keymint log level require a keymint restart. The
[Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION.md#how-changes-are-loaded) has the complete
list.

After changing app routing, close and reopen the affected app to avoid mixing
an already-open operation with the new route. If a process restart is still
needed for a clean boundary, restart the injector only; an injector-only
setting change does not require a keymint restart. After installing or updating
the whole module, reboot the device.

A successful WebUI save follows the injector hot-reload path and needs no
keymint restart. Close and reopen the selected app when you need a clean
routing boundary.

If you changed `vb_key` or `vb_hash` from `"random"` back to `"auto"`, a full
reboot is required. The automatic value cannot return until the next boot.

### What happens if I make a mistake in a configuration file?

A TOML syntax error, an unknown injector field, or an unsupported configuration
version is not applied while OMK is already running; the affected component
keeps its last valid settings. An unknown injector `log_level` is a special
case: the file remains valid and the level falls back to `debug`. Restarting
with a broken `config.toml` prevents keymint from starting, and restarting with
a broken `injector.toml` disables OMK request routing.

Restore a valid backup. A repaired `injector.toml` is loaded automatically;
restart the injector only if routing does not recover. A repaired `config.toml`
requires a keymint restart. If a configuration file is completely missing at
startup, OMK creates a new default file. Do not delete `config.toml` as a reset
method: its newly generated `[crypto]` values may make existing OMK keys
unusable.

### Does an update overwrite my settings or keybox?

No. OMK preserves the active settings and keybox files during an update. The
active personal configuration remains authoritative.

## Keybox and stored keys

### Do I have to replace the bundled keybox?

Only if you have a valid replacement and understand where it came from. The
bundled file is a fallback template; it is not a promise that every current
service or detector will accept it.

Never download private keyboxes from an untrusted source and never publish a
keybox that you use.

### What makes a keybox valid?

OMK requires at least one complete RSA or EC entry. Every private key present
must match its certificate chain. A keybox containing both algorithms uses the
signer that matches the attested key when available. A keybox containing only
one algorithm uses its sole key to sign all attestation leaf certificates,
including leaves whose public key uses the other algorithm.

RKP-extracted keyboxes are legitimately EC-only and do not need an added RSA
entry. The file must also be clean XML, without watermarks, comments inserted
into key data, invisible characters, or other extra content.

A file working in another module does not prove that it is valid. Some other
tools accept damaged or incomplete XML that OMK correctly rejects.

### How should I replace `keybox.xml`?

In the WebUI, choose **Change Keybox**. Android's system document picker opens
directly so you can select the file with the default file manager or another
installed storage app such as MT Manager. The picker requests all MIME types
because providers may label XML as `text/plain` or `application/octet-stream`;
the WebUI still requires an `.xml` filename. If the system picker cannot be
opened, the WebUI falls back to its shared-storage browser. The native
`keymint` helper checks the input size, decodes it
as UTF-8, and performs the complete in-memory `KeyBox` validation, including
private-key and certificate-chain matching. It atomically replaces the canonical lowercase
`/data/misc/keystore/omk/keybox.xml` only after every check succeeds. A read,
size, UTF-8, validation, or write failure leaves the current keybox unchanged.

The keybox watcher loads a successful replacement automatically, so a restart
is normally unnecessary. Replacing the keybox preserves ordinary application
signing keys, including passkey credentials; only dedicated `ATTEST_KEY`
entries tied to the previous keybox are retired. Check `keymint.log` afterward.

### Why does a detector say that the certificate is expired or revoked?

That is a keybox problem, not a security-patch setting. Changing
patch-level settings cannot extend a certificate's lifetime or remove a
revocation. Use a currently valid, complete keybox and do not alter certificate
dates.

### Should I delete `/data/misc/keystore/omk/data/`?

Not during a normal update, keybox change, or first troubleshooting attempt.
That folder contains OMK-created keys. Deleting it can sign apps out, make
encrypted app data unreadable, or force identity verification.

Only reset it when you deliberately accept those consequences and have already
made a private backup. Resetting all stored keys is not a general repair step.

### Why did an app lose a key after I added it to or removed it from `scoop`?

Normal System keys and OMK keys are kept separately. Moving an app between the
two services does not copy its existing keys. The app may then report a missing key,
fail to decrypt data, or ask to register again.

Choose the app's routing before signing in or setting it up, then keep that
choice stable. If it has already changed, use the app's own sign-out, reset, or
re-registration process. Be aware that clearing app data can remove local
information.

## Troubleshooting

### What should I check first when OMK appears not to work?

Check these in order:

1. Use a current official release or an identifiable build requested for
   testing.
2. Confirm that the device is in the supported Android and architecture range.
3. Keep the default safety filters and do not run another KeyStore replacement.
4. Confirm the exact app package is in the active `scoop` list.
5. Reboot after installation or a module update.
6. Reproduce the problem once, then inspect the fresh injector and keymint
   logs from that same time.

Changing several settings at once makes the cause harder to find. Keep your
existing `config.toml` and every generated `[crypto]` value. Restore only the
documented filter and intercept defaults in `injector.toml`, then change only
the app list.

### Why does a test app still show "Bootloader unlocked" after installation?

Usually the test app is still using the normal System service because its
package was not selected, the injector did not start, or the active filter
rejected it. The test app's screen alone cannot tell which service answered.

After following the checklist above, look in the fresh injector log for the
test app and an OMK routing result.

### Why do I see "No attestation keys", "TEE damaged", or a similar message?

These messages do not by themselves prove that the phone's hardware is
damaged. They can appear when the test app was not routed to OMK, injection
failed, or the active keybox was missing, invalid, expired, or revoked.

Confirm the app's package, routing log, and keybox log from the same test. OMK
cannot restore factory hardware provisioning if the device's real TEE is
actually damaged.

### Why does an app work outside `scoop` but fail inside it?

The app may be trying to use a System key that OMK does not have, or it may
depend on behavior outside Android's standard KeyStore rules. First account
for the routing change and any existing app keys.

Test only when you can safely sign in or register again. If the same failure
still occurs after a fresh app setup on a current OMK build, report it with
matching logs.

### Why does an app still report root or show a security warning?

OMK does not hide root. A warning can come from an app's own root detection,
package checks, system-property checks, a blocked certificate, or another
module. Passing a key-attestation test does not cancel those checks.

If the warning is identical with the app removed from `scoop`, investigate the
rest of the root setup. If it appears only when OMK handles the app, provide a
routed and unrouted comparison from the same app and build.

### Why do two detector apps disagree?

They may be testing different systems. Key attestation, Play Integrity,
Tencent Soter, app-specific root detection, and a displayed `sdkVersion` are
not the same thing. Soter in particular is a separate framework and is not
provided by OMK.

Compare the exact test names instead of treating every "locked", "tampered",
or "secure" label as the same result. Use OMK's routing and keymint logs to
decide whether OMK handled the request.

### Why does the displayed KeyMint or Android version look unexpected?

Android version, KeyMint interface version, and attested OS version are
different values. The Android release alone does not determine the exposed
KeyMint version; that also depends on the device maker's system files.

In `config.toml`, `os_version = "auto"` detects the Android major each time the
keymint process starts, including the first start after a system-version
upgrade. An integer keeps that major fixed instead. KeyMint packs the resolved
value in AOSP `MMmmss` form, so fixed `os_version = 16` is reported as `160000`.
The OS patch level uses `YYYYMM`, while vendor and boot patch levels use
`YYYYMMDD`. OS and vendor source properties use AOSP date strings and are
converted before they are sent to the TA. Boot auto mode can also preserve a
decimal bootloader wire value, including a legacy header value whose missing
day is `00`. These different widths and representations are expected.

If a service response omits a field such as `sdkVersion`, do not assume that
the KeyMint version explains it. The cause may still be unknown. Do not force a
setting merely to change a label; if the result causes a real failure, report
the exact field and matching logs.

### Are empty IMEI2 or MEID values a problem?

Not necessarily. A device can legitimately have one IMEI, no second IMEI, no
MEID, or no telephony identifiers. Leave automatic discovery enabled and do
not invent values just to fill empty fields.

An app should fail for a missing identifier only when it specifically asks for
that identifier. Empty optional fields do not invalidate the other device
information.

### Why can fingerprint authentication still fail?

The app may require the lock-screen PIN or password instead of a fingerprint,
or the authorization may have expired before the operation started. A log such
as `KEY_USER_NOT_AUTHENTICATED` does not always mean OMK is broken.

Authenticate in the way the app requests and retry promptly. Keep
`force_skip_system_biometric_hat_verification` at `false` unless a maintainer
is diagnosing a confirmed device-specific compatibility problem.

### Why do logs show `KEY_NOT_FOUND`, RSA errors, or repeated failures?

A missing key is an expected error when an app asks for a key that was deleted
or was created through the other service. Decryption errors can also mean that
the app supplied data that does not match the key. An error line is not proof
that OMK crashed.

Look for a real user-visible failure at the same time. Do not erase all OMK
keys to silence the log. If a current build fails with a newly created key and
a normal app flow, include the full matching operation in a bug report.

### Does every `WARN` or `ERROR` line mean something is broken?

No. Best-effort device probes, expired authentication attempts, missing
keys, and rejected invalid requests may be logged even when OMK is working as
intended. Judge the line together with the app behavior and nearby log entries.

A report is useful when it contains a repeatable symptom and logs from the
same time, not just an isolated word such as `ERROR`.

### What should I do if Android cannot unlock or the user interface does not start?

Restore the default `injector.toml`, especially the app list and safety filter,
then reboot. If you allowed Android packages, system services, or unknown
callers, undo that change first.

If Android cannot start normally, use the root manager's documented safe mode
or module-disable method to disable OMK. Do not keep testing a broad
interception configuration on important data.

### Where are the logs, and will they grow forever?

The log files are:

- `/data/misc/keystore/omk/logs/keymint.log`
- `/data/misc/keystore/omk/logs/keymint.log.1`
- `/data/misc/keystore/omk/logs/injector.log`
- `/data/misc/keystore/omk/logs/injector.log.1`

`debug` is the normal default and is useful while reproducing a problem. You
can lower the level in each component's active configuration after testing.
The injector applies a valid level change automatically; changing the keymint
level requires a keymint restart. OMK rotates the logs; all four files together
are limited to about 16 MB in normal operation.

For a report, note the exact reproduction time and also collect
`logcat -d -s OhMyKeymint` from the same attempt.

### What should I include in a bug report?

Use the
[bug report form](https://github.com/qwq233/OhMyKeymint/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)
and include:

- the full release tag or build identity, not just "latest";
- Android version, ROM, kernel, root framework and version, and ABI;
- the affected app's package name;
- only the relevant, redacted settings;
- the shortest repeatable steps and exact reproduction time;
- matching keymint, injector, and `logcat` output; and
- a same-build comparison with and without OMK routing when the problem affects
  one app.

Screenshots alone are rarely enough. Do not upload the whole OMK data folder.

### Which information must never be shared?

Never publish:

- keybox private keys or an unredacted `keybox.xml`;
- any value under `[crypto]`;
- the OMK key database;
- IMEI, IMEI2, MEID, device serials, account details, or other personal data;
  or

If a maintainer needs information above, share it with proper measures.
